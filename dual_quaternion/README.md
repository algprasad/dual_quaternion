Installation instructions: 
Make sure you have eigen library installed. 
Make sure you have CMake.

cd dual_quaternion
mkdir build
cmake ..
make

Since you do not use the Ubuntu 16.04, you might have dependency issues. If anything arises, you can just copy the code directly and build your own library.
